The paper presents a novel approach called Physics-informed Residual Diffusion (PiRD) for reconstructing high-fidelity (HF) flow fields from low-fidelity (LF) observations. The key highlights are: PiRD builds a Markov chain between LF and HF flow fields, facilitating the transition from any LF distribution to the HF distribution, unlike CNN-based methods that are limited to specific LF data patterns. PiRD integrates physics-informed constraints into the objective function, ensuring the reconstructed flow fields comply with the underlying physical laws (e.g., vorticity transport equation) at every step of the Markov chain.
